                <div class="grid-item"><br>Cyberbullying has a significant educational impact, affecting not only students’ learning experiences but also their overall wellbeing and engagement in school. When students are targeted online, they often experience stress, anxiety, and lowered self-esteem, which can make it difficult to concentrate on lessons, complete assignments, and participate in class activities. Fear of being bullied can also lead to absenteeism, as some students may avoid school or online learning platforms to escape harassment. This interruption in learning can result in falling behind academically and reduced motivation to achieve their full potential.</br>

                <br>In addition to academic challenges, cyberbullying can affect students’ social development and relationships with peers and teachers. Victims may feel isolated or withdrawn, struggling to trust classmates and avoiding group work or collaborative projects. This lack of social engagement can impact their ability to develop important communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, students who witness cyberbullying, even if they are not directly involved, may feel unsafe or distracted, which can also negatively influence their focus and classroom participation.</br>

                <br>Addressing cyberbullying in educational settings is crucial to creating a safe and supportive learning environment. Schools that provide guidance, resources, and awareness programs help students recognise harmful behaviour, understand its consequences, and learn strategies to respond effectively. Teaching digital citizenship, empathy, and online responsibility equips students with the skills to navigate online spaces safely and respectfully.</br>

                <br>By reducing incidents of cyberbullying and promoting a culture of respect, schools can improve academic performance, engagement, and overall wellbeing. When students feel safe and supported, they are more likely to participate actively in learning, build positive relationships, and reach their educational goals. Ultimately, tackling cyberbullying not only protects students emotionally but also enhances their ability to succeed academically and socially in both online and offline environments.</br></div>
