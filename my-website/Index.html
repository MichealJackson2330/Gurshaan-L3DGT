In today’s digital world, young people spend a lot of time on social media, gaming platforms, and messaging apps, which makes it important to know how to stay safe online. Cyberbullying happens when someone uses technology to hurt, embarrass, threaten, or isolate another person, and even though it takes place behind a screen, its effects can be very real. The goal of this website is to give you clear, reliable information about what cyberbullying looks like, why it happens, and how it can impact your mental and emotional wellbeing.</br>

Whether you want to learn how to recognise the signs of cyberbullying, understand what to do if it happens to you, or find ways to support a friend who might be struggling, this website offers practical guidance you can trust. You’ll find helpful tips on staying safe online, steps to report harmful behaviour, and advice on how to block or avoid people who cause harm. We also include resources from certified online safety experts, so you know the information you’re getting is accurate and trustworthy.</br>

                <br>Our aim is not only to educate but also to empower you.

We want this website to be a place where you feel informed, supported, and encouraged to speak up when something isn’t right.
