                <div class="grid-item"><br>Cyberbullying raises several important ethical issues because it involves the misuse of technology to harm, embarrass, or control others. At its core, cyberbullying is a violation of respect and fairness, as it targets individuals in ways that are intentional, harmful, and often persistent. Ethically, everyone has a responsibility to treat others with kindness and consideration, both online and offline, and cyberbullying directly contradicts these principles.</br>

                <br>One major ethical concern is the impact on the victim’s mental and emotional wellbeing. Causing distress, fear, or shame to another person for personal amusement or revenge is unethical because it disregards the basic human right to feel safe. Cyberbullying can also encourage bystander complicity; when people witness harmful behaviour online and do nothing, they may be indirectly supporting unethical actions. This raises the issue of collective responsibility, where not only the bully but also those who ignore or enable the behaviour have an ethical duty to act.</br>

                <br>Another ethical issue is honesty and integrity. Cyberbullying often involves spreading false information, creating fake profiles, or manipulating content to damage someone’s reputation. Such actions violate ethical standards of truthfulness and accountability, undermining trust in online spaces. Privacy is also a key ethical concern, as sharing private information or images without consent breaches the ethical obligation to respect others’ personal boundaries.</br>

                <br>Finally, cyberbullying challenges the principle of equality. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity regardless of age, gender, race, or social status, but cyberbullying often targets vulnerable individuals, reinforcing inequality and social harm. Addressing these ethical issues requires teaching digital responsibility, empathy, and respect, helping individuals understand the real-world consequences of online behaviour and encouraging a safer, more positive digital environment.</br></div>
