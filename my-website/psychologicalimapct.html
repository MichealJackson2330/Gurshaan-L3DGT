                <div class="grid-item"><br>Cyberbullying can have a profound psychological impact on victims, affecting their mental health, emotional wellbeing, and overall quality of life. Being targeted online can lead to feelings of fear, anxiety, and helplessness, as victims may feel there is no escape from harmful messages or public shaming. Constant exposure to negative comments, rumours, or threats can erode self-esteem, leaving individuals feeling worthless, embarrassed, or socially rejected.</br>

                <br>Depression is another common effect of cyberbullying. Victims may experience persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, and difficulty concentrating on schoolwork or other responsibilities. In severe cases, prolonged psychological stress can lead to self-harm or suicidal thoughts, particularly among teenagers who are still developing coping mechanisms and resilience. The anonymity of the internet can worsen these effects, as bullies may feel free to act without consequences, making victims feel more vulnerable and powerless.</br>

                <br>Cyberbullying also affects social and emotional development. Victims may withdraw from friends, avoid social situations, or become distrustful of others, leading to isolation and loneliness. This can make it harder to build healthy relationships and develop important social skills. Additionally, even witnessing cyberbullying can have psychological effects, causing fear, anxiety, or guilt for not intervening.</br>

                <br>The long-term impact of cyberbullying can persist well beyond the immediate incident. Victims may struggle with ongoing anxiety, low confidence, and difficulties in forming trusting relationships, both online and offline. Understanding the psychological impact of cyberbullying highlights the importance of early intervention, mental health support, and creating safe, supportive environments where individuals feel protected, valued, and empowered to seek help.</br></div>
